Simple natural selection / ecosystem simulator, for fun

The focus here is to learn how classes, abstract classes, and interfaces work and set them up in as ideal of a system as possible, while
making a cute little game/simulation out of it.

Eventually I plan to use these concepts for a game I'm working on, which doesn't have a name yet.
